1) Debug global alignment error by printing corner backtracking matrix scores
2) Convert Hirschberg to local alignment
	- Change negative first row and column to all zeros
	- Add zero in as possibility when taking max of scores
	- When a score is found, store the position of the score in the backtracking matrix
	- For each leading character position from that score, store pointer to position of start point

IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE OF HOW I DID NEEDLEMAN WUNCSH CALCULATING SCORE DATA
