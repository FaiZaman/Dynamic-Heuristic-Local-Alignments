DYNPROGLIN

Convert Hirschberg to local alignment
	- Change negative first row and column to all zeros
	- Add zero in as possibility when taking max of scores
	- When a score is found, store the position of the score in the backtracking matrix
	- For each leading character position from that score, store pointer to position of start point

Once the end point is found, seq1[max_score_col - 1] is the end point letter of seq1 and seq2[max_score_row - 1] for seq2
